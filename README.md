# The Entity
A Discord Bot I made to replace paid features of other bots. Why pay others when you can code it yourself?
I used discord.py rewritten as the library of choice for making this bot.

# What it does
So far it has a lot of functions that is aimed to replace other bots. These functions can range from creating dynamic voice channels to moderationg chat, to using AI to generate images and chat completions.

# What it does
I used a lot of API's over the development of this project to facilitate its functions. A comprehensive list can be found in the /cogs/ folder, where the functions are separated into their own (categorized) .py files. However some functions to note are:
- Conversating with The Entity using its @ mention
- Recording and wishing people a happy birthday on their birthdays
- Good morning texts that send at a specific time every day
- Personal DMs to people that want daily reminders
- AI image generation based on a given prompt
- Changing the banner and icon of discord server to match the themes of the year

# API's Used
Below are some of the API's that I have used in the development of this bot, to help users have more fun with its functionality
- discord.py API library for making all of this possible
- OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo (soon to be gpt-4)
- OpenAI's Dall-E engine for image generation
- Riot's API (featured in the now-retired league of legends lookup)
- davidteather's Unofficial TikTok API (featured in the now-retired TikTok embedder)
- Tenor's API for gif searching
- Musixmatch's API for the under development $lyrics function

At the moment, this bot is not available for other servers at the moment. While some functions will work across multiple servers, a lot of functions were designed for one server only, and as such, this version of the bot will not be available to the public. If you choose to reuse any of the code I have written, please just make sure to give credit! :)
